# Virtual SOC Lab for Security Monitoring and Attack Simulation

## Objective

The Virtual SOC Lab project aimed to create a controlled setting for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The focus was on using real-world security tools to monitor and respond to various attack scenarios, analyzing logs and network traffic to enhance understanding of network security and defensive techniques. This hands-on approach was intended to build practical skills in threat detection and incident response.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in using security tools for attack simulation and monitoring.
- Ability to analyze and respond to simulated cyber attacks in real-time.
- Enhanced understanding of network traffic and endpoint behavior.
- Skills in setting up and managing a virtual SOC environment.
- Development of incident response strategies and procedures.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log collection and analysis.
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools for monitoring and managing endpoint activities.
- Network simulation tools for generating and analyzing network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Vulnerability assessment tools for identifying and testing system weaknesses.
- Attack simulation platforms for creating realistic cyber attack scenarios.
